This means better performing scenarios will run\n","for longer duration, accumulating larger return.\n","\n","The CartPole task is designed so that the inputs to the agent are 4 real\n","values representing the environment state (position, velocity, etc.).\n","However, neural networks can solve the task purely by looking at the\n","scene, so we'll use a patch of the screen centered on the cart as an\n","input.
